# T3. Performance and Reliability Analysis of Communication Networks

## Task 1 - Discuss the operation of a connection-oriented packet-switched network.

A connection-oriented packet-switched network utilizes properties from both a connection-based network and a packet-switching network. This means it uses the notion of packetization of larger messages, and transmits them on predefined routes (virtual connections). Unlike connectionless networks packets are transmitted sequentially, rather than routed independently. This lowers the overhead as the adress information is only need in the establishment of the virtual circut, rather than for each packet. At the end of a transmision the virtual connection is terminated freeing the resources. 

## Task 2 (Revisit) - differentiate between circuit-switched and packet-switched networks
In a Circuit-switched network a physical link is reserved for communication, this is useful in real-time traffic, as channel resources are allocated to the network it will ensure that the network is in full control of congestion on the network. 
In circuit-switching, there is no notion of packetizing, meaning data is transmitted sequentially and there is no need for reassembling of the message at the receiver. As a fixed route is establsied at the beginning there is no need for address information in subsequent messages, lowering the overhead. If the traffic varies in data rate it will result excessive allocation of resources at times. This inefficient use of resources result in more expensive network construction cost.

The primary difference in packet-switching networks is the introduction of packetization, which splits large messages into packets which can be handled according to some protocol. Here the notion of connection-oriented or connectionless networks determine how each individual packet is treated in the network. If the network is connectionless, each packet is routed and transmitted independently, with no guarantee for correct ordering at the receiver. On the other hand connection-oriented networks use the same concept of establishing a circuit (albeit a virtual one), where packets are transmitted sequentially along predetermined routes. This leads to the connectionless variant requiring more overhead, as each packet must contain address information.

In regards to billing, packet-switching will be data size based, where circuit-switching will be time based i.e. how long you were on your phone.

## Task 3 - How does TCP work?

### Setup phase
In the setup phase a there way handshake establish the connection. Before the setup is possible, the server must be bound to a port which the client can access. 

The 3-way handshake consists of:

1. **SYN:** The client sends a random 32 bit segment sequence number A, thereby opening the server port.
2. **SYN-ACK:** The server acknowledges the SYN by sending a SYN-ACK with a 32 bit acknowlegdement number with the recived segments sequence number + 1 (A+1), along with a random sequence number B
3. **ACK:** The Client then Acknowlegdes the server ACK with a sequens number of A+1 and a Acknowlegdement number of B+1.

Once the setup phase is complete, the data transfer phase can begin.

### Data transfer phase
The data transfer phase consists of segmentation and sequencing, where the data stream is split into segments of appropriate sizes, each segment is assigned a sequence number, which establishes the order in which reception should happen. Each segment is assigned a TCP header, which contains this sequence number as well as a field for denoting missing or lost segments.

Each segment is transmitted sequentially, and the receiver confirms reception by cumulative acknowledgement, meaning it transmits an ACK indicating the sequence number of the last segment which was received correctly. The TCP header provides additional fields like the window size and checksum, used for flow/congestion control, error detection and retransmissions used during data transfer.

</div>


### Teardown phase
The teardown phase denotes the procedure used for terminating a TCP connection. The teardown phase procedure consists of:

1. **Client Fin** - The client sends a message with the *Fin* flag set, indicating there is no more data to transmit.
2. **Server Fin-ACK** - Acknowledgement message for the client fin.
3. **Server data transfer** - The connection is now half-closed, the server will still transfer data since it has not closed its connection.
4. **Client data ACK** - The client acknowledges the data sent from the server in the half-closed state.
5. **Server Fin** - The server sends the fin flag, indicating the connection should be closed
6. **Client Fin-ACK** - The client acknowledges the reception of the fin flag and the connection is fully-closed.

## Task 4 - Differentiate TCP and UDP. Which of these protocols is better, and for what applications?
User Datagram Protocol (UDP), is typically preferred in applications such as video streaming, where real-time transmission of data is of more importance than correct ordering or guaranteed reception. Due to the simplicity (No ACK or retransmission) and low overhead (8 B) of UDP, it provides freedom to implement application layer based layer flow control, which has given rise to protocols such as QUIC, which keeps the low overhead of traditional UDP, while borrowing concepts and functionality from TCP.

At the cost of larger overhead (20-60 B) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) comes with a rich feature set such as congestion control, acknowledgements (ACKs) Retransmission, Flow control and reordering of packets. TCP is therefore suited for non real-time traffic, as it ensures all packets are reaching the destination, and are ordered correctly.

## Task 5 - Discuss TCP features and why they are important
- **TCP flow and congestion control:** - It is important as it improves the goodput of the transmission while reducing the overall congestion on the network. Hereby allowing for a shared medium.
  
- **Reordering of packets:** - Important, as incorrectly ordered data would in many cases not make sense. It also allows for Selective Acknowlegement (SACK), meaning the receiver can specify which segments are missing, allowing the transmitter to only retransmit these, rather than all subsequent segments.  


## Task 6 - What is HoL blocking problem? Discuss potential solutions
Head of Line (HoL) blocking, refers to the scenario in which packets are being transmitted correctly, but the application is failing to process a packet. This problem occurs in HTTP 2.0 when used TCP due to the in-order delivery requirement from TCP. HTTP 2.0 introduced the concept of having multiple streams over the same TCP connection (reusing the connection for multiple objects). However, since HTTP 2.0 uses a single TCP connection, it is subject to the ordering requirement, meaning, the data from streams are put into a queue and processed in by the application in order. HoL blocking occurs when the application is failing to process a segment of data, meaning the queue is blocked despite being delivered correctly.

A solution to this problem was introduced in the QUIC protocol, in which the in-order requirement is rephrased to each HTTP stream. Here, each HTTP stream is treated seperately, and the order requirement is limited to the individual streams. This means HoL blocking may still occur, but it is now only blocking a single HTTP stream and not completely restricting the processing of data.
