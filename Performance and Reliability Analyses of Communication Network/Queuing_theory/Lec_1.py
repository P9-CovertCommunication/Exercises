#  Write a code simulating a behavior of a system consisting of 10 servers and having Blocked
# Call Cleared (BCC) behavior.
# Consider 4 different cases:
# 1. Poisson arrivals, exponential service times.
# 2. Poisson arrivals, constant service times.
# 3. Constant interarrival times, exponential service times.
# 4. Constant interarrival times, constant service times.
# The arrival rate is set to 4 and the average service time 2.4 (so that the offered load is 4 x
# 2.4 = 9.6 erlangs).
# The simulations should be run for

# a) 100 arriving customers;\\
# b) 10.000 arriving customers;\\
# c) 100.000 arriving customers.\\

# Calculate probability of blocking given by Erlang B formula; P10 and ùúã10 . The results should
# be filled in the following table:
